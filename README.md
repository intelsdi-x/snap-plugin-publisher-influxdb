## Getting Started

### System Requirements

* [golang 1.5+](https://golang.org/dl/) (needed only for building)

Support Matrix

- InfluxDB Plugin: v2 -> InfluxDB Version 0.9.1 -> snap version 0.2.0
- InfluxDB Plugin: v3 -> InfluxDB Version >= 0.9.1 -> snap version 0.2.0
- InfluxDB Plugin: v4 -> InfluxDB Version >= 0.9.1 -> snap version 0.3.x
- InfluxDB Plugin: v6 -> InfluxDB Version >= 0.9.1 -> snap version 0.8.0-beta
- InfluxDB Plugin: v7 -> InfluxDB Version >= 0.9.1 -> snap version 0.8.0-beta-114 and greater
- InfluxDB Plugin: v12 -> InfluxDB Version >= 0.9.3 -> snap version 0.8.0-beta-114 and greater
- InfluxDB Plugin: v12 -> InfluxDB Version >= 0.9.4 -> snap version 0.13.0-beta and greater

### Known Limitation

* InfluxDB (tested with InfluxDB 0.10.0) does not support uint64 as type of data. Metrics with uint64 type are converted to int64 by snap publisher plugin. uint64 values higher than maximum int64 value are converted to negative value and saved in InfluxDB. Overflow cases are logged.

### Installation

#### Download InfluxDB plugin binary:
You can get the pre-built binaries for your OS and architecture at snap's [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap/releases) page.

#### To build the plugin binary:
Fork https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap-plugin-publisher-influxdb  
Clone repo into `$GOPATH/src/github.com/intelsdi-x/`:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/<yourGithubID>/snap-plugin-publisher-influxdb.git
```

Build the plugin by running make within the cloned repo:
```
$ make
```
This builds the plugin in `/build/rootfs/`

### Configuration and Usage
* Set up the [snap framework](https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap/blob/master/README.md#getting-started)
* Ensure `$SNAP_PATH` is exported  
`export SNAP_PATH=$GOPATH/src/github.com/intelsdi-x/snap/build`
